In the context where NFTs are gaining broader adoption as a form of digital asset, there is a clear demand for a marketplace that is user-friendly, easy to navigate, and supports effective asset management. A review of existing NFT marketplaces shows that while many platforms offer comprehensive features, the user experience can be overwhelming—especially for newcomers—due to complex buying/selling flows, information overload, and a lack of focus on what truly matters for decision-making such as pricing, key attributes, ownership, transaction history, and price trends. In addition, creators often lack a simple, consolidated view to track the performance of their collections and trading activity in a straightforward way. Based on these issues, this project aims to build an NFT Marketplace with a business-oriented, user-centered approach that streamlines the core lifecycle: creating collections, minting NFTs, listing, buying/selling, managing assets, and viewing essential analytics. The system prioritizes clear presentation of decision-critical information (price, attributes, ownership, history, and trends) and provides a basic dashboard that helps users quickly understand asset status and trading performance. The expected outcome is a functional marketplace that supports the main business flows end-to-end, lowers the entry barrier for general users, and serves as a solid foundation for future enhancements and scaling.
